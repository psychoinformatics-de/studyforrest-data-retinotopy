title: Retinotopic Mapping


description: |
  "All participants in the phase2 extension of the studyforrest dataset
   underwent retinotopic mapping with standard flickering checkerboard stimulus
   (ring and wedges). More information on the procedure and the results can be
   found in:

     Ayan Sengupta, Falko R. Kaule, J. Swaroop Guntupalli, Michael B. Hoffmann,
     Christian Häusler, Jörg Stadler, Michael Hanke. An extension of the
     studyforrest dataset for vision research. (submitted for publication)

   We acknowledge the support of the Combinatorial NeuroImaging Core Facility
   at the Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology in Magdeburg. M.H. was supported
   by funds from the German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt and the European
   Regional Development Fund (ERDF), Project: Center for Behavioral Brain
   Sciences. This research was, in part, co-funded by the German Federal
   Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF 01GQ1112, 01GQ1411) and the US
   National Science Foundation (NSF 1129855, 1429999) as part of two US-German
   collaborations in computational neuroscience (CRCNS). We are grateful to
   the Haxby lab, Paul Downing, the maintainers of the BOSS stimulus library,
   and the CBCL street scene library for making the stimulus material publicly
   available. We appreciate the editing efforts of Alex Waite and do publicly
   acknowledge the excellent beer making traditions of the great state
   of Wisconsin."
